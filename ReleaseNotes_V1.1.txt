Change Description
==================

  This new version (1.1) of the ACIS Focal Plane Thermal Model has
  three categories of changes:

    I) Create the run.dat file regardless of the value of the verbose
       switch
 
   II) Do not label the run "NOT OK" when a preference for a cold and
       stable focal plane temperature has not been met. Also, whether
       the preference was met or not met, the report used the term
       "violation" This was changed to "Preference Not Met".

  III) Split out ACIS-I observations from ACIS-S and assign different
       violation temperatures to the two different categories.

Rationale
==========
    I) It was observed that the model did not write out the run.dat file
     for cetain values of the verbose switch.  We want the run.dat
     file to be created for any verbosity level.

   II) ACIS observations with certain characteristics have a preference
      for a cold and stable focal plane temperature. Prior to this
      update,  when the preference was not met the Status output by
      the model was "NOT OK".  As this is only a preference and not a 
      requiremnent of the observation, the output status should be
      "OK" even if the preference is not met. Likewise, use of the
      term "violation" was too strong. 


  III) After much discussion, the idea of changing the violation
       temperature of all ACIS-S observations to -112.0 deg. C was approved.
       The violation temperature for ACIS-I observations would remain
       unchanged at -114.0 deg. C.  Now that this change is
       operational, the behavior of the ACIS Focal Plane Predictive
       model must also change to reflect that new set of limits.

       The plot showing the range of focal plane temperatures going
       from -120 to -114 was changed to -120 to -111.5.  Horizontal
       lines were added to illustrate the ACIS-I and ACIS-S
       limits. The file name was also modified.


Files Changed:
============== 

	ACISobs.py
	MANIFEST
	VERSION
	acisfp_check.py
	index_template.rst
	index_template_val_only.rst
        html4css1.css

  index_template_val_only.rst was modified to correct the comments.


Justification:
==============

    I) We want the run.dat file to be available under all verbose modes -
       both in testing and in operational use.

   II) The Status line on the report is the first indicator the ACIS Ops
       person uses to determine that the load is ok from a Focal Plane
       Thermal point of view.  A report of "OK" means the load is ok; a
       report of "NOT OK" means the load may have to be rejected.

       As meeting the cold and stable focal plane value is a preference and
       not a requirement, "NOT OK" is not a valid response, and the
       use of the term "violation" too strong.

  III) Violations of the thermal limits are a valid reason for
       rejecting the load. As the limit for ACIS-S observations were split
       out and given a different value than used for ACIS-I observations,
       the model violation assessment code had to be changed, as well
       as the reporting code.


Testing:
======== 

    I) The model was run with verbosity set at 0, 1 and 2. The run.dat
       file is now created in all three cases.
 
   II) Two loads were used to perform the testing as they displayed
       all the different characteristics of observations that are
       sensitive to a cold and stable focal plane temperature:

          - Observations which prefer a cold and stable focal plane
            temperature

              - Which were Met
              - Which were Not Met

          - Observations whose characteristics imply a preferred cold
            and stable focal plane temperature but the preference has
            been waived.



   APR0416 

      - 17233 18825 are FP Temp sensitive and in fp_sensitive.txt
      - Neither obs appears in the No Preferences list. 
      - The preference was not met in the actual run
      - Actual run Status was NOT OK

      After the changes:
        - Load reported OK
        - preferences were shown to "Not Met" as opposed to "Violation"

      - Temporarily set 17233 in the No Pref file
        - No Longer shows in the Pref Not Met table
        - painted purple on the plot
     ALL PASSED

  APR1816 

      - 18068 is in the NOPREF file so it's painted purple.
      - No violation reported.
      - Checks to be sure that 18068 purple NO PREF is displayed


 III)  APR1816 

   Set ACIS_I_RED to -115 to generate violations
     PASSED
       - Status reported as NOT OK
       - Correct Violations Listed
       
   Set ACIS_S_RED to -115 to generate violations
     PASSED
       - Status reported as NOT OK
       - Correct Violations Listed
    
   Set both ACIS_I_RED and ACIS_S_RED to -115 to generate violations
     PASSED
       - Status reported as NOT OK
       - Correct Violations Listed
 
   Neither ACIS_I_RED and ACIS_S_RED generates violations
     PASSED
       - Status reported as OK for both classes of violation
       - No Violations Listed
 
Testing on new loads:
=====================

MAY0916 - Results reported correctly
MAY1616 - Results Reported Correctly - No ACIS-I or S violations; 
                                     - FP Temp Preference reported as
				       Not Met
                                     - FP_TEMP Status: OK


Interface impacts
=================

There are no interface impacts.

Once approved at a Load Review telecon the software will be installed
in the operational area.
