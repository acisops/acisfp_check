Change Description
==================

  The new OR Viewer DOT generation code eliminated the CRM Pad Time
  file from the tarball and replaced it with a CTI_report file.  This
  new version (1.2) of acisfp_check.py contains a minor change in 
  that function which annotates the perigee passages on the focal
  plane temperature plots.

  This change makes the acisPF_check.py program compatible with both
  old style CRM Pad Time file tarballs as well as tarballs created
  from the OR Viewer DOT.



Rationale
==========

  All columns of the CRM Pad Time file were fully populated, and the
  time range of the file extended several weeks before and after the
  load week in question. 

  The CTI_report file covers precisely the time of the load week and
  no more.  Therefore it is possible to have a line in the file which
  contains  information for a CTI run but no perigee passage time
  value. the ACISfp_check.py plot annotation function allows handling
  of either CRM Pad Time files or CTI_report files.



Files Changed:
============== 

    acisfp_check.py

       Function:  paint_perigee


    Version 1.1:

          # Plot the perigee passage time
          perigee_time = Ska.Matplotlib.cxctime2plotdate([DateTime(eachpassage[3]).secs])
          plots[msid]['ax'].vlines(perigee_time, -120, 20, linestyle=':', color='black', linewidth=2.0)
          


    Version 1.2:


          # Plot the perigee passage time so long as it was specified in the CTI_report file
          if eachpassage[3] != "Not-within-load":
              perigee_time = Ska.Matplotlib.cxctime2plotdate([DateTime(eachpassage[3]).secs])
              plots[msid]['ax'].vlines(perigee_time, -120, 20, linestyle=':', color='black', linewidth=2.0)
        

Testing:
======== 

Tests were run to be sure that the paint_perigee function executed
correctly with both old load tarballs containing the CRM_Pad_time
files or the new OR Viewer-generated tarballs which contain the
CTI_report files.

Outputs were compared with the originals in the case of the CRM Pad
Time file tarball. In the case of new Test Loads, the software is run
against all new loads that have come out so far and results compared
with the results generated by the V1.1 software.
